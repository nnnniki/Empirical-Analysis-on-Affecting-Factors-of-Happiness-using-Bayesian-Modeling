# Empirical-Analysis-on-Affecting-Factors-of-Happiness-using-Bayesian-Modeling
Human happiness can be affected by many factors, such as wealth, income, welfare, health, political environment, freedom of speech, etc. This paper mainly focuses on understanding the most important factors that affect happiness using Bayesian Modeling and therefore provides policy recommendations to people of interest to help them better understand what factors contribute to happiness the most and then make policy changes according to the analysis. The analysis shows that the most important factors that affect happiness are 1) Freedom to make life choices, 2) Life Welfare, 3) Generosity, 4) Social Support, 5) GDP and it also shows the correlation between the above 5 variables with happiness and their coefficients to show whether they are positive or negative correlated with our target variable happiness.
